"""
Test comprehensive conftest.py fixture validation across project structure.

This module validates that all fixtures defined in conftest.py work correctly
across different test directories and scenarios in the men's circle management
platform, ensuring robust test infrastructure.

TDD Approach:
- Test fixture accessibility before implementing all components
- Validate fixture behavior matches expected contracts
- Ensure fixtures work in isolation and combination
