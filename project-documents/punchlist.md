## SUCCESS METRICS (from Product Brief)

- **User Adoption**: 90% active usage within 60 days of launch
- **Payment Success Rate**: Increase on-time payments by 40%
- **Administrative Time Savings**: Reduce manual tasks by 70%
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with <200ms response times
- **Member Engagement**: 80% weekly goal completion rate

## CORE FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVED

✅ **Six user roles with flexible, additive permissions**
✅ **Circle management for 2-10 member groups**
✅ **Flexible event system (movie nights to multi-day retreats)**
✅ **Stripe payment integration with manual intervention**
✅ **Secure messaging with hierarchical routing**
✅ **Mobile-first PWA design**
✅ **Separate credential storage with encryption**
✅ **Real-time features via WebSocket**
✅ **GDPR compliance and data privacy**
✅ **Test-driven development approach**

## ELIMINATED OVER-ENGINEERING

❌ **Excessive validation layers** (5+ structure validation approaches → 1 simple validation)
❌ **Premature optimization** (performance testing → wait for real load)
❌ **Complex CI/CD infrastructure** (25 docker test items → basic CI/CD)
❌ **Over-specified testing** (770+ tasks → focus on business logic)
❌ **Analysis paralysis items** (follow-up enhancement tasks → post-launch)

**Total Tasks Reduced**: From 770+ to ~85 focused, launch-critical tasks
**Timeline**: 14 weeks instead of 20-22 weeks
**Focus**: Building working software that delivers business value
