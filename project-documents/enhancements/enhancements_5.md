# Enhancement 5: Role-Based Access Control System

## Task 5.1: Define Six User Roles - COMPLETED ✅

### Overview

Successfully implemented the complete role-based access control (RBAC) system for the Men's Circle Management Platform with six distinct user roles as defined in the product brief.

### Implementation Summary

#### Six System Roles Defined

1. **Member** (Priority: 10)

   - **Description**: Basic circle participation and event registration
   - **Permissions**: 7 permissions including circles:view, events:register, profile:manage
   - **Use Case**: Basic users who participate in circles and events

2. **Facilitator** (Priority: 20)

   - **Description**: Circle creation and management capabilities
   - **Permissions**: 15 permissions including all Member permissions plus circles:create, circles:manage, meetings:schedule
   - **Use Case**: Circle leaders who manage groups of 2-10 members

3. **PTM - Production Team Manager** (Priority: 30)

   - **Description**: Event production, logistics, staff coordination
   - **Permissions**: 16 permissions including events:production, events:logistics, staff:manage
   - **Use Case**: Staff responsible for event production and coordination

4. **Manager** (Priority: 40)

   - **Description**: Team and resource management
   - **Permissions**: 15 permissions including teams:manage, budgets:manage, resources:allocate
   - **Use Case**: Middle management overseeing operations and teams

5. **Director** (Priority: 50)

   - **Description**: Strategic oversight and operations
   - **Permissions**: 16 permissions including operations:oversight, finances:view, partnerships:manage
   - **Use Case**: Senior leadership with strategic responsibilities

6. **Admin** (Priority: 60)
   - **Description**: System administration and user management
   - **Permissions**: 21 permissions including system:admin, users:manage, security:audit
   - **Use Case**: Technical administrators with full system access

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema

- **Permission Model**: Resource:action naming convention (e.g., "circles:create")
- **Role Model**: System roles with priority hierarchy and metadata
- **UserRole Model**: Many-to-many association with assignment tracking
- **RoleAuditLog Model**: Complete audit trail for all role changes

#### Key Features Implemented

1. **Additive Permissions**: Users with multiple roles inherit permissions from all assigned roles
2. **Context Switching**: Users can switch between their assigned roles as needed
3. **Role Hierarchy**: Priority-based system with clear escalation levels
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete tracking of role assignments, removals, and context switches
5. **Permission Checking**: Middleware and decorators for endpoint protection
6. **Flexible Assignment**: Roles can be assigned/removed with metadata and notes

#### Database Tables Created

- `permissions` - 55 distinct permissions across all system domains
- `roles` - 6 system roles with full configuration
- `user_roles` - Association table with assignment metadata
- `role_audit_logs` - Complete audit trail for compliance

#### Permission Structure

Organized across key domains:

- **Circles**: View, create, manage, join, add/remove members (8 permissions)
- **Events**: View, register, create, manage, production, logistics (6 permissions)
- **Users**: Create, manage, delete, assign roles (4 permissions)
- **System**: Configure, maintain, backup, admin (4 permissions)
- **Messages**: Send, receive, broadcast at various levels (4 permissions)
- **Resources**: Manage, allocate, budget oversight (3 permissions)
- **Analytics & Reports**: View data and generate insights (2 permissions)
- **Leadership**: Strategic planning, partnerships, vision setting (8 permissions)
- **Security & Compliance**: Audit, logs, data management (6 permissions)

### Test Coverage

- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test suite written first
- **14 Passing Tests**: Full validation of role system functionality
- **68% Code Coverage**: Approaching 80% target with core functionality covered
- **Integration Testing**: Database seeding and verification confirmed

### Technical Architecture

#### Service Layer

```python
class RoleService:
    async def assign_role(user_id, role_name, assigned_by, is_primary=False)
    async def remove_role(user_id, role_name, removed_by=None)
    async def get_user_roles(user_id)
    async def get_user_permissions(user_id)
    async def switch_user_context(user_id, role_name)
    async def get_current_context(user_id)
    async def get_audit_logs(user_id, limit=50)
```

#### Permission Checking

```python
class PermissionChecker:
    async def has_permission(user_id, permission_name)
    async def require_permission(user_id, permission_name)

@require_permission("circles:create")
async def create_circle_endpoint(current_user):
    # Endpoint automatically protected by decorator
```

### Database Migration & Seeding

- **Migration**: `b37f99db0c0e_add_role_based_access_control_tables.py`
- **Seeding Script**: `backend/scripts/seed_roles.py` with verification
- **Status**: Successfully deployed with all 6 roles and 55 permissions

### Verification Results

```
✅ Member: 7/7 permissions
✅ Facilitator: 15/15 permissions
✅ PTM: 16/16 permissions
✅ Manager: 15/15 permissions
✅ Director: 16/16 permissions
✅ Admin: 21/21 permissions

✅ Successfully seeded 6 system roles and 55 permissions!
```

### Security Considerations

- **Audit Trail**: Every role change logged with metadata
- **Permission Validation**: All permissions validated before assignment
- **Context Security**: Role switching restricted to user's assigned roles
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and validation rules enforced

### Future Enhancements (Post-Task 5.1)

- Custom role creation (beyond the 6 system roles)
- Time-limited role assignments with expiration
- Role templates for common permission sets
- Advanced permission inheritance patterns
- Integration with external identity providers

### Compliance & Audit Features

- Complete role assignment history
- Permission change tracking
- User context switching logs
- Administrative action attribution
- GDPR-compliant audit data retention
