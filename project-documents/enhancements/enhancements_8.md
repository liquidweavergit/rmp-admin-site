**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Test Coverage**: 80%+ (TDD methodology followed)  
**Component Coverage**: Backend API and service layer implemented

### Overview

Enhancement 8.5 implements a comprehensive member transfer request system that allows circle members to request transfers to other circles, with facilitator approval workflow.

- Request enters "pending" state
- Facilitator of target circle reviews and approves/denies the request
- If approved, facilitator can execute actual transfer using existing functionality
- Complete audit trail maintained throughout process

### Backend Implementation

- Data validation and constraint enforcement

**Database Schema**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE transfer_requests (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    requester_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    source_circle_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES circles(id),
    target_circle_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES circles(id),
    reason TEXT(1000),
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
