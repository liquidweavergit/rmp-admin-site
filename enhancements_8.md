**TDD Implementation**: ✅ PASSING - Test-driven development methodology followed

### Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive circle member view component that allows users to view their circle participation and meeting history. The implementation follows TDD methodology with comprehensive test coverage and includes all required features for member engagement tracking.

### Implementation Details

#### Component Architecture

**File**: `frontend/src/components/circles/CircleMemberView.tsx` (595 lines)

The component implements a two-stage interface:

- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded chips showing circle status (active, inactive, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout adapting to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA labels

##### 2. Participation Summary

- **Attendance Statistics**: Visual display of attendance rate with percentage
- **Payment Status**: Current payment status with color-coded indicators
- **Attendance Breakdown**: Detailed statistics showing present, late, and absent counts
- **Membership Timeline**: Shows join date and current/longest attendance streaks

##### 3. Meeting History

- **Meeting List**: Chronological list of all meetings with attendance status
- **Expandable Details**: Click to expand meeting cards showing:
  - Meeting notes and agenda
  - Personal attendance notes
  - Check-in/check-out times
  - Meeting duration and attendance summary
- **Attendance Status**: Visual indicators (Present, Late, Absent) with color coding
- **Date Filtering**: Dropdown filters for date range selection
- **Pagination**: Support for large meeting lists with page navigation

##### 4. Interactive Features

- **Date Range Filtering**: Filter meetings by custom date ranges
- **Meeting Expansion**: Toggle detailed view for individual meetings
- **Navigation**: Back button to return to circle selection
- **Real-time Updates**: Integration with Redux store for live data

#### Technical Implementation

##### Store Integration

Enhanced `frontend/src/store.ts` with new API endpoints:

- `getUserCircles`: Fetch user's circle memberships
- `getCircleMembershipDetails`: Get detailed membership statistics
- `getUserAttendance`: Retrieve user's attendance records
- `getMeetings`: Fetch meeting history with pagination

##### TypeScript Interfaces

Added comprehensive type definitions:

```typescript
interface UserAttendanceResponse {
  status: "present" | "late" | "absent";
  checked_in_at?: string;
  checked_out_at?: string;
  notes?: string;
}

interface MeetingWithAttendanceResponse {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  scheduled_date: string;
  location_name: string;
  meeting_notes?: string;
  attendance_summary: AttendanceSummary;
  user_attendance?: UserAttendanceResponse;
}

interface MembershipStatsResponse {
  total_meetings_scheduled: number;
  meetings_attended: number;
  meetings_late: number;
  meetings_absent: number;
  attendance_rate: number;
  current_streak: number;
  longest_streak: number;
}
```

##### Material-UI Components Used

- **Cards & Lists**: Circle selection and meeting display
