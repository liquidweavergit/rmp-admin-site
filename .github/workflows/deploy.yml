# Workflow Summary Comment
# This Deployment workflow for the Men's Circle Management Platform provides:
# 1. Automated Docker image building and registry publishing
# 2. Staging deployment with smoke testing
# 3. Production deployment with comprehensive health checks
# 4. Post-deployment validation of platform-specific features
# 5. Detailed deployment reporting and monitoring
#
# The workflow supports:
# - Manual deployment to staging or production environments
# - Automatic staging deployment on main branch pushes
# - Automatic production deployment on version tags
# - Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
# - Comprehensive validation of Men's Circle Platform features
# - Database migration handling (main + credentials databases)
# - Performance validation against product brief targets
# - Rollback capabilities and monitoring integration
