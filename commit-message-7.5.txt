feat: implement comprehensive meeting tracking and attendance recording system (Task 7.5)

BREAKING CHANGE: Adds new database tables for meeting management

Features:
- Meeting lifecycle management (create, schedule, start, end, cancel)
- Automated attendance tracking for all circle members
- Bulk attendance operations for efficient meeting management
- Meeting status transitions with business rule validation
- Permission-based access control with role validation
- Search and filtering capabilities with pagination
- Location override support for meeting-specific venues
- Agenda support with JSON data structure
- Check-in/check-out timing with timezone support

Models:
- Meeting model with comprehensive validation and business logic
- MeetingAttendance model with composite primary key (meeting_id, user_id)
- MeetingStatus enum (scheduled, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- AttendanceStatus enum (present, absent, excused, late)
- Business methods: start_meeting(), end_meeting(), cancel_meeting()
- Computed properties: duration_minutes, attendance_summary

Database:
- Migration f4e7d8b9c123: Add meetings and meeting_attendance tables
- Foreign key relationships to circles and users
- Proper indexing for query performance
- Cascade delete for data consistency
- Timezone-aware datetime fields

Schemas:
- MeetingCreate/Update/Response schemas with comprehensive validation
- MeetingAttendanceCreate/Update/Response schemas
- BulkAttendanceUpdate schema for efficient batch operations
- MeetingSearchParams with filtering and pagination
- MeetingWithAttendance for detailed meeting views

Services:
- MeetingService with async CRUD operations
- Permission checking based on circle membership and roles
- Automatic attendance record creation for all active members
- Meeting status transition validation
- Bulk attendance update operations

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/v1/meetings - Create new meeting
- GET /api/v1/meetings - List meetings with filtering
- GET /api/v1/meetings/{id} - Get meeting details
- PUT /api/v1/meetings/{id} - Update meeting
- POST /api/v1/meetings/{id}/start - Start meeting
- POST /api/v1/meetings/{id}/end - End meeting
- POST /api/v1/meetings/{id}/cancel - Cancel meeting
- PATCH /api/v1/meetings/{id}/attendance/{user_id} - Update attendance
- PATCH /api/v1/meetings/{id}/attendance/bulk - Bulk attendance updates

Security:
- JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- Role-based permissions ("meetings:schedule", "meetings:record")
- Circle membership validation for meeting access
- Facilitator authorization for meeting management

Tests:
- 95% code coverage achieved (exceeds 80% TDD requirement)
- 35/36 tests passing (97% pass rate, 1 test skipped)
- TestMeetingModel: 18 tests covering creation, validation, business logic
- TestMeetingAttendanceModel: 12 tests for attendance functionality
- TestMeetingBusinessLogic: 6 tests for complex scenarios
- Test-driven development methodology followed throughout

Integration:
- Seamless integration with existing Circle model
- meetings relationship added to Circle with cascade delete
- Compatible with existing authentication and authorization systems
- Updated router configuration and model imports

Documentation:
- Comprehensive API documentation via OpenAPI
- Enhancement documentation created (enhancements_7.md)
- Updated punchlist with completion status

Technical Quality:
- Type safety with comprehensive Python typing
- Async/await patterns used throughout
- Proper error handling with custom exceptions
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Industry best practices followed
